# A Neural Fuzzy Controller
This is my PhD Dissertation. The long title is "STABILITY ENHANCEMENT OF MULTI-MACHINE POWER SYSTEMS
BY HYBRID NEURAL FUZZY-LOGIC CONTROL"
There is a software tool written in FORTRAN producing the simulation results. The project was supported partially by SaskPower, the Provincial Utility of Saskatchewan.
The software tool will be open-sourced on this site.
